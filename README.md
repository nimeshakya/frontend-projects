# Frontend Development Projects
This repo is a collection of several frontend development projects that I made along the way of learning the front end technologies and techniques.
### Project 1: Navigation Bar
This navigation bar project is made using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. The webpage with the navigation bar is highly responsive with relatively good user interface and experience.
