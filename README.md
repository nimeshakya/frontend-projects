# Frontend Development Projects

This repo is a collection of several frontend development projects that I made along the way of learning the front end technologies and techniques.

### Project 1: Navigation Bar

This navigation bar project is made using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. The webpage with the navigation bar is highly responsive with relatively good user interface and experience.

### Project 2: Landing

A page that may be placed before a product launch. Here users get a beatiful "coming soon" page and a form to sign up for newsletter from the product creators.

### Project 3: Todo-list

This is a ReactJS project. It is a todo list app where users can keep track of their day to day task. The simple design helps to make the todo app more intuitive to users and boost their productivity.
